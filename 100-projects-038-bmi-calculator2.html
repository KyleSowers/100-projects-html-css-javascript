      <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure used to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height.
        It is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height. The unit of BMI is kg/mÂ².
        <br><br>
        The BMI cartegories for adults according to the World Health Organization (WHO) are:<br>
        - Below 18.5: Underweight<br>
        - 18.5-24.9: Normal Weight<br>
        - 25-29.9: Overweight<br>
        - 30 and above: Obesity<br><br>
        Please note that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it does not directly measure body fat.
        It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for a full understanding of your health.
